    "Similarly to what happens in human communication, where there are the vocabulary, syntax, grammar and other language constructs designed for people to understand each other, digital systems also use a set of rules (known as protocols) to interact with each other. Any communication process always involves a transmitter (e.g. you) and a receiver (e.g. your colleague), which can generally change roles, but also a channel (e.g. air), through which the message is conveyed. In this lesson we will experiment with digital data transmission, in particular, using the computer as the transmitter/receiver, the Arduino as the receiver/transmitter, the asynchronous serial communication protocol as the “language” for them to understand each other, and the hardwired USB connection as the channel through which they communicate."
