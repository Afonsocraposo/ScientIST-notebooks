However, THE SAFETY OF YOUR\nARDUINO NEEDS TO BE A TOP PRIORITY as you are typically\nmore dangerous to the device than it will be to you. <br>\nNEVER connect the pins labelled as POWER directly between them (e.g.\nthe 3.3V pin to the 5V pin). <br>\nNEVER connect the voltage pins to another (external) voltage source,\nregardless of its type. <br>\nNEVER connect the voltage pins to the GND. <br>\nNEVER leave unconnected (aka “live”) wires floating around your board\nas they can inadvertently create short circuits between components.\nNEVER bend, twist, cut, score, apply weight or otherwise perform any\nmechanical abuse to your board; it is fragile! <br>\n\nALWAYS have your board disconnect from the computer while assem-\nbling your circuits!\n <br>\nContrary to what often happens with general computer use and infor-\nmatics, dealing with electronic devices IS NOT A TRIAL AND ER-\nROR PROCESS.
