How Does Your Heart Tick? </div>\n\nThe electrical conduction system of the heart is composed by the sinoatrial\nnode (SA node) that normally initiates the cardiac cycle, the atrioventricular\nnode (AV node), the internodal atrial pathways, which connect the two and\nregulate the passage of the cardiac impulse from the atria to the ventricles, and\nthe bundle of His and corresponding branches, which in turn are terminated by\nthe Purkinje fibers [1, 2]. This system enables the electrical triggering impulses\ngenerated at the SA node, to be propagated from the wall of the right atrium\n(where the SA node is located), to the deeper tissues of the ventricular muscles\n(through where the Purkinje fibers are spread).\n\nThe ultimate result of this overall bioelectrical action is the heartbeat. The following Figure depicts the contribution of each specialized group of cells to the typical\ncardiac cycle waveform [2]. The depolarization of the atria generates an ECG\nwave (P wave), followed by the QRS complex, which represents the ventricular\ncontraction. The end of the cardiac cycle is the cell repolarization phase, which\nappears as another deflection, the T wave; in some cases, the a second deflection\nmay appear, the U wave.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VHkcjJx/0607a.jpg\" alt=\"0607a\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\">\n\nWhen measured non-invasively, the ECG records the combined contribution\nof each component of the electrical conduction system of the heart, as propagated to the body surface, and which is expressed as the typical P-QRS-T\ncomplexes. It is important to highlight the existence of subject-dependent information, due to the size, shape, and position of the heart within the chest\ncavity, which varies amongst individuals. Furthermore, other factors such as\ntissue conductivity, genetic singularities, congenital disorders, and heart conditions, constitute additional variability sources.\n\nThe following Figure illustrates the ECG while at rest, from two different subjects\nwithout any reported heart condition.\n\n    Electrocardiographic recordings from two different subjects while at rest, where the time series were processed to extract one hundred individual heartbeat waveforms, which were then clipped and scaled to fit to the same XX and YY axis limits for better comparison. Figures (b) and (c) depict the individual waves overlapped, with a solid line representing the mean wave, and a dashed line representing the standard deviation. Figures (a) and (d) depict a color-map plot, where each line corresponds to an individual heartbeat wave form, and each column represents the amplitude value of a sample; in the color-map, the signal was smoothed around the R peak to enhance the color intensities in the remaining signal.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hyvKz92/ECGrecordings.png\" alt=\"ECGrecordings\" border=\"0\">\n\nThe plotted individual waveforms yi were normalized to the mean wave  ̄x computed from the original segmented heart-\nbeat waveforms xi (eq. 9.2) and clipped for better visual understanding. Both subjects exhibit morphologically distinct waveforms, with a low intersubject\nvariability; the intensity map of the segmented heartbeat waveforms, showing\ntheir temporal evolution, further enhances the differences.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/x5FsmXK/eq.png\" alt=\"eq\" border=\"0\">\n\nWaveforms of each specialized cells found in the heart (source: [2]).\n\nAmongst other singularities, in these two cases, the P-Q and S-T curves and\nlatency are significantly distinct; the relative amplitude P-T also varies between\nsubjects. Comparing the ECG of Subject A and B, we observe for example that\nthe bundle branches and Purkinje fibers have a lower activation amplitude in\nSubject B, or that the AV node recovery time is lower in Subject A.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### <div style=\"color:#00a0e4\">   1.3. Reading the Messages from Within  </div>\n\nThe ECG is now a main stream technique with unquestionable clinical useful-\nness, and especially measurement methods have greatly evolved ever since the\n\nearly days; the voltage potential differential is the most common ECG measure-\nment principle, however, modern capacitive [3] and ballistic methods [4] can also\nbe use to acquire ECG-like signals, with the advantage of enabling contactless\nmeasurement. Despite the underlying operating principle, several devices have\nemerged throughout the years, that enable ECG signal acquisition and which\nwe’ve classified according to their intrusiveness level:\n• In-the-person: one class of devices are implantable systems (e.g. artificial\ncardiac pacemakers), which are highly intrusive devices, invasive even, that\nare surgically placed inside the body, with multiple leads attached to the\nheart, enabling the continuous monitoring of its behavior; other devices\nin this category include implantable loop recorders (ILR), which are only\napplied subcutaneously through a simple medical procedure which only\nrequires local anesthesia;\n\n• On-the-person: the most common approach for ECG measurement available to date, is by attaching a device externally to the body surface;\nstandard ECG devices for hospital use require the placement of 12 or\nmore leads mounted on the chest and limbs, and generally need conductive paste or gel to improve, but new developments in signal acquisition technology greatly improved the usability, and now enable highly wearable\nform factors such as a necklace [5], or a t-shirt [6, 7];\n• Off-the-person: 100 year after the first known commercial system became\navailable, trend has been towards moving the sensor away from the person,\nand having it integrated into objects with which the subject regularly\ninteracts with, thus improving the acceptability and ease-of-use; state-\nof-the-art work has proven the feasibility of measuring a biometric-grade\nECG at the hands and/or fingers, even without the need for special gel or\nconductive paste.\n\nThe Figure in Section II.1.1. depicts one of the first know commercial ECG machines (a), in which the patient was required to immerse both of hands and one foot\nin a saline solution for improved conductivity with the electrodes, and a modern\nECG apparatus (b), designed to measure the ECG at the hands or\nfingers using only two contact points with the subject and which can integrated\ninto a wide variety of daily use objects. Enabling responses to common problems\nsuch filtering, segmentation, and outlier detection, can now be found within\nthe state-of-the-art, further paving the way for a real-world deployment and\ncommercial feasibility of ECG biometrics in selected application scenarios [8].","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### <div style=\"color:#00a0e4\">   1.4. Tools to Measure Cardiac Activity  </div>\n\nAs in other modalities, ECG signals are quite feeble and have a very low amplitude, several orders of magnitude lower than what the typical measurement \nequipment can handle. It is therefore necessary to amplify them from the original millivolt-level amplitude, to a scale that is less sensitive to noise and that can \nbe managed by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Although the amplitude\ncan greatly vary with the electrode placement location, an amplification gain of \naround 1100x is generally found as providing a sensor measurement range suitable for a wide array of applications. In addition to the amplification, filtering is \nalso an important component, to help remove unwanted noise sources and limit the sensor output to the frequency band of interest within cardiac signals. The frequency bands of interest greatly depend on the application, however the 0.05-\n40Hz band is a typical useful range for both monitoring and basic diagnostic\nmode.\n\nUntil recently, the tools for ECG sensing were quite costly, complex to manage and deploy in practical do-it-yourself projects, however, nowadays there are \na number of off-the-shelve devices that incorporate the required tools to measure\nECG signals in a user-friendly way. An example of such tools is your BITalino,\nwhich includes an ECG sensor. \n\n    Location of the Electrocardiography (ECG) sensor on BITalino:\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/80gGTgR/BIT-ECG.png\" alt=\"BIT-ECG\" border=\"0\">\n\n\nThe IN+ & IN- pins are the input\nfrom the signal leads, while REF is the input from the reference lead. There\nare a number of options that can be used to interface the sensor with the body,\nbut the most standard way is to use a cabled connection between the pre-gelled\nelectrodes placed at the body surface and the sensor, as shown in the following Figure.\n\n    Example of a single lead Eithoven-like electrode placement with IN+ (red) & IN- (black)\n    placed on the collarbones and REF on the iliac crest:\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pP5YdmG/ECG-Placement.jpg\" alt=\"ECG-Placement\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <div style=\"color:#00a0e4\">  2.

If you don’t have a previous recording already, record a file with resting Electrocardiography (ECG) sensor data in ASCII format (using OpenSignals), by applying the electrodes in an Eithoven triangle (or equivalent) setup (e.g. Figure 9.5); a pre-recorded example of ECG data can be downloaded from:\n    https://github.com/BITalinoWorld/revolution-sample-data/tree/master/ECG\n\n    2.
